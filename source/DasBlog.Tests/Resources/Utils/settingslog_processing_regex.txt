this is the regex for extracting the dasblogSettings values from the xunit test logs

bash -c "grep £££ test_results.xml > xxx.csv"
apply (.*)(£££[^\[]*)(.*) and replace with $2 (or was it $1)
non regex replace of £££...closing paren ov value with '
non regex replace of result = with ,
non regex replace of ' with "

or something like that
