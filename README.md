# Dasblog
The [DasBlog Blogging Engine](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa480016.aspx) reintroduced with ASP.NET Core

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/poppastring/dasblog-core?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/poppastring/dasblog-core)


## Core Tenets - "This we believe"

- We want to pragmatically reuse core DasBlog projects where feasible (includes reusing existing config files).
- Do not be afraid to abandon features/projects that are easily solved with a NuGet package (Pop3, CAPTCHA, Noda Time, etc.)
- Let's use Razor for "Themes"
- Port the custom logging solution to use .NET Core
- DI all the things (avoid massive static objects)
- WISH: Build on Linux (clone/build)
- WISH: Docker version with XML files outside in volume mount


## Installing the development tools

- Install [.NET Core SDK 2.1.300](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/thank-you/dotnet-sdk-2.1.300-windows-x64-installer)
- Install [Visual Studio Community 2017 (15.7.1 or newer)](https://www.visualstudio.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=15)

You can find more specific installation steps for Windows development [here](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windowscmd)
